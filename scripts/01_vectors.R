# File Names
# File names should also indicate their content, e.g., we try to avoid saving files as "code.csv" or "xyzq.R".
# We also avoid diacritical marks, special characters, and spaces.
# Itâ€™s also useful to add a number at the beginning of the name if there is a fixed order for analysis.

# Using Functions for Vectors

x_norm <- seq(from = -4, to = 4, length.out = 100)
x_norm  # What is the result of this?

?seq  # Help on the seq function
x_norm <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)  # What will happen if we don't provide the argument 'length.out'?

y_norm <- dnorm(x_norm)

plot(x_norm, y_norm, type = "l")

# Task: Create an atomic vector with any name, containing a series of numbers in the range from -100 to 100, with a step of 5 (tip: see help for the seq() function).

# Task: Create a vector with 10 letter elements. Use the sample() function to randomly select one.

# Filtering Data

letters  # The letters vector contains lowercase letters of the alphabet

letters[4]  # Retrieves the 4th letter: "d"
letters["d"]  # returns NA because indexing by name isn't supported
letters[letters == "d"]  # Filters and returns the letter "d"
my_favorite_letters <- c("k", "z")
letters[letters %in% my_favorite_letters]  # Filters and returns only the favorite letters "k" and "z"

numbers <- 1:9  # A vector of numbers from 1 to 9

numbers[3]  # Retrieves the 3rd number: 3
numbers[numbers > 3]  # Filters and returns numbers greater than 3
numbers[numbers/2 == 2]  # Filters and returns numbers where dividing by 2 gives 2

c(letters, numbers)  # Combines letters and numbers into a single vector
